As a software developer, I have a passion for exploring new technologies, particularly in the areas of artificial intelligence, game development, Fullstack Django, and mobile technology. 
I have experience in Python, Django, React Native, Linux, and server-side security and project management. 
In game development, I have worked with Unity, Unreal Engine, and Unigine 2, and have completed two projects using Flutter and React Native.
I have also developed two mobile applications from design to backend using Java.
I am constantly improving myself in the field of software development and enjoy taking on new challenges to find innovative solutions.
I enjoy keeping up with the latest technologies and applying them to my work.
